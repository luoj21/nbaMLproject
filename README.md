# Predicting NBA Salaries

This project is aimed at attempting to predict an NBA player's annual salary based on various factors such as their career statistics. In this project, various machine learning algorithms were tested, namely multiple linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, and a regression random forest. While there are various external factors that can drastically influence how much a player gets paid, this project will use these algorithms to predict salaries as accuractely a possible subject to various constraints and assumptions on our data.

This entire project is done using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Some packages used include:
- Numpy
- MatPlot Lib
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- SciKit Learn
- Dalex
